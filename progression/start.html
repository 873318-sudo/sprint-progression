    <h2>1.1: Reassurance</h2>
    <p>
        Let me get something straight with you as a mindset shift before I start teaching you how to execute a block start effectively,

        this is something to keep in mind for the rest of the website.

        The blocks are important, but it’s not everything⁽¹⁾.

        The same goes for anything else in the 100m, top speed, top speed maintenance/endurance, your late acceleration, whatever,

        that’s because every part (or phase) in the 100m is built off of the last one, they’re not entirely different things on their own.

        For example, if top speed requires relaxation otherwise your form will get messed up, that doesn’t mean your start doesn’t need it,

        it’s just more dominant in the top speed phase.

        Meaning, just because you did some top speed training the other day, you can still get faster in the start phase indirectly.

        Why?

        Because your neuromuscular efficiency improves.

        Simply, your nervous system’s (your brain being the center, which is why the name central nervous system comes up a lot) ability to effectively fire the right muscles,

        so you can maximize your force application and basically optimize every metric in sprinting.

        Say you’re trying to lift a heavy weight,

        With high neuromuscular efficiency, your nervous system can fire the right muscles all at the same time and with the right effort, making it easier to execute said task⁽²⁾.

        Sprinting is a highly mental game⁽³⁾, keeping this locked in is critical for quality sessions instead of going through the motions,

        …and the best part?

        It is highly trainable⁽⁴⁾.

        truly unleashing your maximum potential.

        And remember, everything here is traditional, experimentation to find what works for YOU is HIGHLY recommended.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2: Block start</h2>
    <p>
        The block start is actually simpler than some people make it seem.

        If you know what a four or three-point start looks like (2 feet and both hands on floor is 4-point, 2 feet and 1 hand on floor is three-point),

        it’s basically that, but with pads.

        The block starts are super structured, even though they look complicated and everyone has their own way of doing them⁽⁵⁾.

        BUT, it can be broken down into this order:
        <ul>
            <li>The set-up of the blocks</li>
            <li>“On your marks” position</li>
            <li>“Set” position</li> 
            <li>Push-off (when the gun fires)</li>
        </ul>

        Note that the block start is the most “tutorial” wise segment of the progression, as it is the most unique thing to sprinting,

        but that doesn’t change the main purpose.

        The set-up:
        You hear everyone say, 2 feet on the front, 3 on the back.

        What does it actually look like?

        From the starting line on the track, count 2 foot-lengths (heel touches the start line).

        That’s where the front pad goes, at the end of your foot.

        Then, count another foot-length from the front pad or just count three foot-lengths from the starting line.

        That’s where the back pad goes.

        Once you get more advanced, you can start using your fingers to get more precise measures once you find what’s best for you.

        Whichever foot goes front or back depends on what you’re most comfortable with.

        And if you wanna figure that out…

        Stand straight, then fall forwards,

        Whichever foot you catch yourself with is generally the foot that goes in front⁽⁶⁾.

        “On your marks” position:
        Much simpler than the set-up of the blocks.

        The action is you simply just get into the blocks.

        Once you get into the blocks, this is what should be in your position:
        <ul>
            <li>Hands just behind the start line, around shoulder-width apart</li>
            <li>Hands are NOT flat</li>
            <li>Your shoulders should be perpendicular or leaning over your hands</li>
            <li>Knee of the back leg should be resting on the track</li>
            <li>Pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Feel tension running from the arm through the shoulders</li>
        </ul>
        
        “Set” position:
        Now, this one matters slightly more than the “on your marks” position.

        What should I do? Get up using your hips.

        Here’s what should be there:
        <ul>
            <li>Still pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Hips slightly higher than shoulders</li>
            <li>Weight must be forward</li>
            <li>Back leg roughly 120 degrees</li>
            <li>Front leg roughly 90 degrees</li>
        </ul>

        If that sounds difficult to coordinate or imagine, the mental cue

        “You should feel ready to explode off at any moment.”

        …gets your technique most of the way there.

        The push-off:
        This is the moment you’re going to PUSH off your front foot as hard as you can.

        The back foot?

        Pull it to the front to take the next step as fast and as low as possible.

        You should have:
        <ul>
            <li>Triple-extension (front leg extends fully)</li>
            <li>Body leaves track low, around 45 degrees in most cases</li>
            <li>Head and neck stay neutral and relaxed, not facing too down or too up</li>
            <li>The opposite of your front leg has your arm swinging forward aggressively</li>
            <li>Back foot snaps forward and stays low</li>
            <li>Shin angles at roughly the same angle as your body/torso</li>
        </ul>
    
        As another mental cue,

        “You should feel like you’re trying to push the earth behind you, NOT just taking a step.”

        What about the first step?

        In the general sense:

        You do the same thing as the push-off but your arms are slightly tighter because there's less ground to pull your back leg from step 1 to 2, compared to the push-off to step 1.
