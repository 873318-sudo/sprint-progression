    <h2>1.1: Reassurance</h2>
    <p>
        Let me get something straight with you as a mindset shift before I start teaching you how to execute a block start effectively,

        this is something to keep in mind for the rest of the website.

        The blocks are important, but it’s not everything⁽¹⁾.

        The same goes for anything else in the 100m, top speed, top speed maintenance/endurance, your late acceleration, whatever,

        that’s because every part (or phase) in the 100m is built off of the last one, they’re not entirely different things on their own.

        For example, if top speed requires relaxation otherwise your form will get messed up, that doesn’t mean your start doesn’t need it,

        it’s just more dominant in the top speed phase.

        Meaning, just because you did some top speed training the other day, you can still get faster in the start phase indirectly.

        Why?

        Because your neuromuscular efficiency improves.

        Simply, your nervous system’s (your brain being the center, which is why the name central nervous system comes up a lot) ability to effectively fire the right muscles,

        so you can maximize your force application and basically optimize every metric in sprinting.

        Say you’re trying to lift a heavy weight,

        With high neuromuscular efficiency, your nervous system can fire the right muscles all at the same time and with the right effort, making it easier to execute said task⁽²⁾.

        Sprinting is a highly mental game⁽³⁾, keeping this locked in is critical for quality sessions instead of going through the motions,

        …and the best part?

        It is highly trainable⁽⁴⁾.

        truly unleashing your maximum potential.

        And remember, everything here is traditional, experimentation to find what works for YOU is HIGHLY recommended.
