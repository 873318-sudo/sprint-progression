    <h2>1.1: Reassurance</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Let me get something straight with you as a mindset shift before I start teaching you how to execute a block start effectively,</strong><br><br><br>

        this is something to keep in mind for the <strong>rest of the website.</strong><br><br><br>

        The blocks are <strong>important,</strong> but it’s not everything⁽¹⁾.<br><br><br>

        The same goes for anything else in the 100m, top speed, top speed maintenance/endurance, your late acceleration, <strong>whatever,</strong><br><br><br>

        that’s because every part (or phase) in the 100m is <strong>built off of the last one,</strong> they’re not entirely different things on their own.<br><br><br>

        For example, if top speed requires relaxation otherwise your form will get messed up, that doesn’t mean your start doesn’t need it,<br><br><br>

        it’s just more <strong>dominant</strong> in the top speed phase.<br><br><br>

        Meaning, just because you did some top speed training the other day, you can still get faster in the start phase indirectly.<br><br><br>

        <strong>Why?</strong><br><br><br>

        <strong>Because your neuromuscular efficiency improves.</strong><br><br><br>

        Simply, your nervous system’s (your brain being the center, which is why the name central nervous system comes up a lot) ability to effectively fire the right muscles,<br><br><br>

        so you can maximize your force application and basically optimize every metric in sprinting.<br><br><br>

        Say you’re trying to lift a heavy weight,<br><br><br>

        With high neuromuscular efficiency, your nervous system can fire the right muscles all at the same time and with the right effort, making it <strong>easier to execute said task</strong>⁽²⁾.<br><br><br>

        <strong>Sprinting is a highly mental game</strong>⁽³⁾, keeping this locked in is critical for quality sessions instead of going through the motions,<br><br><br>

        …and the best part?<br><br><br>

        <strong>It is highly trainable</strong>⁽⁴⁾.<br><br><br>

        <strong>truly unleashing your maximum potential.</strong><br><br><br>

        And remember, everything here is <strong>traditional,</strong> experimentation to find what works for YOU is HIGHLY recommended.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>1.2: Block start</h2>
    <p>
        The block start is actually simpler than some people make it seem.<br><br><br>

        If you know what a four or three-point start looks like (2 feet and both hands on floor is 4-point, 2 feet and 1 hand on floor is three-point),<br><br><br>

        it’s basically that, but with pads.<br><br><br>

        The block starts are super structured, even though they look complicated and everyone has their own way of doing them⁽⁵⁾.<br><br><br>

        BUT, it can be broken down into this order:
        <ul>
            <li>The set-up of the blocks</li>
            <li>“On your marks” position</li>
            <li>“Set” position</li> 
            <li>Push-off (when the gun fires)</li>
        </ul>

        Note that the block start is the most “tutorial” wise segment of the progression, as it is the most unique thing to sprinting,<br><br><br>

        but that doesn’t change the main purpose.<br><br><br>

        The set-up:
        You hear everyone say, 2 feet on the front, 3 on the back.<br><br><br>

        What does it actually look like?<br><br><br>

        From the starting line on the track, count 2 foot-lengths (heel touches the start line).<br><br><br>

        That’s where the front pad goes, at the end of your foot.<br><br><br>

        Then, count another foot-length from the front pad or just count three foot-lengths from the starting line.<br><br><br>

        That’s where the back pad goes.<br><br><br>

        Once you get more advanced, you can start using your fingers to get more precise measures once you find what’s best for you.<br><br><br>

        Whichever foot goes front or back depends on what you’re most comfortable with.<br><br><br>

        And if you wanna figure that out…<br><br><br>

        Stand straight, then fall forwards,<br><br><br>

        Whichever foot you catch yourself with is generally the foot that goes in front⁽⁶⁾.<br><br><br>

        “On your marks” position:
        Much simpler than the set-up of the blocks.<br><br><br>

        The action is you simply just get into the blocks.<br><br><br>

        Once you get into the blocks, this is what should be in your position:
        <ul>
            <li>Hands just behind the start line, around shoulder-width apart</li>
            <li>Hands are NOT flat</li>
            <li>Your shoulders should be perpendicular or leaning over your hands</li>
            <li>Knee of the back leg should be resting on the track</li>
            <li>Pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Feel tension running from the arm through the shoulders</li>
        </ul>
        
        “Set” position:
        Now, this one matters slightly more than the “on your marks” position.<br><br><br>

        What should I do? Get up using your hips.<br><br><br>

        Here’s what should be there:
        <ul>
            <li>Still pushing into the pads</li>
            <li>Hips slightly higher than shoulders</li>
            <li>Weight must be forward</li>
            <li>Back leg roughly 120 degrees</li>
            <li>Front leg roughly 90 degrees</li>
        </ul>

        If that sounds difficult to coordinate or imagine, the mental cue<br><br><br>

        “You should feel ready to explode off at any moment.”<br><br><br>

        …gets your technique most of the way there.<br><br><br>

        The push-off:
        This is the moment you’re going to PUSH off your front foot as hard as you can.<br><br><br>

        The back foot?<br><br><br>

        Pull it to the front to take the next step as fast and as low as possible.<br><br><br>

        You should have:
        <ul>
            <li>Triple-extension (front leg extends fully)</li>
            <li>Body leaves track low, around 45 degrees in most cases</li>
            <li>Head and neck stay neutral and relaxed, not facing too down or too up</li>
            <li>The opposite of your front leg has your arm swinging forward aggressively</li>
            <li>Back foot snaps forward and stays low</li>
            <li>Shin angles at roughly the same angle as your body/torso</li>
        </ul>
    
        As another mental cue,<br><br><br>

        “You should feel like you’re trying to push the earth behind you, NOT just taking a step.”<br><br><br>

        What about the first step?<br><br><br>

        In the general sense:<br><br><br>

        You do the same thing as the push-off but your arms are slightly tighter because there's less ground to pull your back leg from step 1 to 2, compared to the push-off to step 1.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>1.3: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        Now for the important part, why?<br><br><br>

        Why do we do all of these specific things that people tell us to do?<br><br><br>

        What’s the science behind this that led us to coaches teaching this?<br><br><br>

        Here’s the fun part, because the absolute core idea of why we do this stuff for a block start actually connects to Newton’s First Law of Motion.<br><br><br>

        In fact, most of the “why” in sprinting ties a lot to basic physics.<br><br><br>

        If you don’t know what it is, it says:<br><br><br>

        “An object in motion will stay in motion, while an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by an external force.”<br><br><br>

        The “unless acted upon” part?<br><br><br>

        That’s the key.<br><br><br>

        The primary goal is to overcome your inertia as quickly as possible in order to start moving⁽⁷⁾.<br><br><br>

        The secondary goal? The primary goal is used to set you up for the rest of the race.<br><br><br>

        With that in mind, every specific element in your start makes complete sense.<br><br><br>

        Take low shin angles.<br><br><br>

        Sounds confusing at first on why we do it, right?<br><br><br>

        But if you break it down, the fastest way from point A to point B is obviously a straight line, which is what low shin angles are trying to achieve.<br><br><br>

        And when I say fastest, that means the fastest way to overcome inertia, which ties back into the primary goal.<br><br><br>

        That’s why some good sprinters toe drag in their starts,<br><br><br>

        it is a byproduct (something you wouldn’t consciously pay attention to) of low-shin angles and a good start in general, not the cause of low-shin angles.<br><br><br>

        You can apply the primary goal to any specific start mechanic.<br><br><br>

        Take triple-extension as another example.<br><br><br>

        Sounds like it has no correlation to the primary goal.<br><br><br>

        But the triple-extension actually happens because you’re trying to push off of the front leg as long as possible,<br><br><br>

        while the back leg is trying to move from point A to point B (the next step).<br><br><br>

        And that maximizes your force application as quickly as possible<br><br><br>

        BOOM, now it ties back into the primary goal.<br><br><br>

        One thing to keep in mind is that the triple-extension is not a byproduct because unlike the toe drag,<br><br><br>

        you don’t actually care if toe-drag is happening or not as long as your shin angles stay low, but if there is no triple-extension…<br><br><br>

        That tells you that you are not finishing the push, which is something to fix.<br><br><br>

        You can attempt to see if you can connect the primary goal cleanly to every element mentioned in the sprint start.<br><br><br>

        But now, it’s time to really ingrain this idea into your brain.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>1.4: Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Now we can take your new understanding of the sprint start and apply it in order to analyse an angle of my sprinting start.<br><br><br>

        While comparing it to an elite sprinter known as Asafa Powell⁽⁸⁾.<br><br><br>

        We’ll be analysing both the start position and the first step.<br><br><br>

        Start position<br><br><br>

        I’m going to ask you first, what do you notice?<br><br><br>

        Well, one thing for certain is that Powell is using a block start, while I’m on a 3-point start.<br><br><br>

        But, since you know about our primary goal, you now understand that it’s still trying to achieve the same outcome, even if the mechanics are slightly different.<br><br><br>

        So, what’s actually different here?<br><br><br>

        Not much, if you’re looking at the image as a whole and not at the details.<br><br><br>

        If you really focus on the specifics, you’ll notice:<br><br><br>

        My arm is a little bit too far up, it could be a little bit lower to be closer to my body so it can move faster right away,<br><br><br>

        that can delay the pull of the back leg.<br><br><br>

        My head could also be a bit more neutral and relaxed compared to Powell’s, his is more “resting”.<br><br><br>

        The real difference is in the shin angles.<br><br><br>

        Powell’s shins are visibly much lower and ready to project forwards at any moment,<br><br><br>

        while mine, especially in the front foot, is much more vertical, meaning it takes longer to get moving right away.<br><br><br>

        That also makes the rest of my body pop up way faster, because the force is going up, not ideal for our secondary goal,<br><br><br>

        once again, that delays the time to apply horizontal force<br><br><br>

        Remember, we need to be able to push off at any moment.<br><br><br>

        His hips are also a little bit higher than his shoulders,<br><br><br>

        my hips are more in-line with my shoulders, which also makes me pop-up way sooner, not supporting a low torso angle.<br><br><br>

        Taking those into consideration, what could I do better?<br><br><br>

        That’s to put my legs into a better position to push harder, and lower, while also making the hips support a low torso angle.<br><br><br>

        Which overcomes inertia way faster, THAT’s what we want.<br><br><br>

        The start position is not supposed to be comfortable, it’s supposed to make you fast.<br><br><br>

        This one is me and Powell on the first step.<br><br><br>

        Let me ask again, do you spot any differences?<br><br><br>

        You can’t immediately see it from the image, but the intent of the two are way different.<br><br><br>

        I’m trying to move fast right away, not push hard<br><br><br>
        Powell actually looks like he’s striking with the foot and pushing harder, which is what actually overcomes inertia.<br><br><br>

        You can also see the secondary goal from the start position really come into play.<br><br><br>

        Based on that, because my hips from last time were in-line with my shoulders instead of slightly higher,<br><br><br>

        Combined with my shin angles pointing upwards and not forwards?<br><br><br>

        Now you can see how my torso is higher than Powell’s, but most importantly…<br><br><br>

        My low torso angle is forced, not natural.<br><br><br>

        And that distracts the fact that the purpose of the low torso is there to help you control the direction of that push,<br><br><br>

        if I’m too focused on trying to stay low…<br><br><br>

        Then there’s no point in staying low in the first place.<br><br><br>

        My knee also is lower than Powell’s, he has intent to strike down and produce force.<br><br><br>

        My leg looks like it’s just letting the foot land.<br><br><br>

        The foot itself is also not dorsiflexed (it’s supposed to look like the foot is pointing forwards, not down) enough.<br><br><br>

        And that’s a huge difference in both speed and strength.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>1.5: Application</h2>
    <p>
        Now you might be wondering: “How can I apply what I just learned into my training?”<br><br><br>

        This is where it shifts: knowing what to do is easy, actually doing it is hard.<br><br><br>

        You might be unmotivated now, even disappointed because you’ve probably heard that a thousand times.<br><br><br>

        The statement is true.<br><br><br>

        BUT, it goes way deeper than that, and I can hopefully reignite your drive.<br><br><br>

        The exercises that I’m about to tell you (and for the rest of the website) are not ultra-rare gatekept exercise that only the elites do,<br><br><br>

        in fact, they probably do most of these exercises already.<br><br><br>

        What’s different is that I’m not just giving you the exercises anymore,<br><br><br>

        you know where they’re coming from.<br><br><br>

        You have the mental cues, science, and even analysis.<br><br><br>

        That knowledge turns every exercise done with good quality and intention, not just going through the motions.<br><br><br>

        THAT’S why this is maximizing your speed potential.<br><br><br>

        The exercises/drills that obviously (and you might already do in your training) improve your start are:<br><br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Falling starts (teaches low torso and shin angle)</li>
            <li>Sled sprints (train overcoming inertia by producing more force)</li>
            <li>Hamstring curls (so you don’t crumble in the middle of acceleration)</li>
            <li>Hill sprints (higher knee drive and more torso angles)</li>
            <li>Heavy plyos (apply high force faster)</li>
        </ul>

        If you’re a younger athlete (12-16)?<br><br><br>

        I recommend you don’t even do these kinds of exercises yet.<br><br><br>

        What?<br><br><br>

        Yeah, when you’re at this kind of age, your body is at its peak growth phase (sometimes called a superplastic state)⁽⁹⁾, if you try these exercises and train the wrong movements.<br><br><br>

        Or worse, get injured.<br><br><br>

        Your brain will make it stick with you way harder in the future than if you were already grown.<br><br><br>

        Which is a pain to get out of.<br><br><br>

        At that age, what you should be focusing on is training to be able to do those reps properly in the first place instead of after some bad habit developed.<br><br><br>

        That means doing exercises that are mostly low-risk, bodyweight, and support your body so you don’t fall apart.
        <ul>
            <li>Push-ups (arm drive, core control)</li>
            <li>Plank and side plank (even more core control)</li>
            <li>Glute bridges (activates the glutes)</li>
            <li>Lunges (single-leg strength)</li>
            <li>Joint health (stretching and mobilizing)</li>
            <li>Reactive plyometrics (like pogo hops or squat jumps)</li>
        </ul>
        
        None of these exercises are trying to show off, that’s exactly why they work.<br><br><br>

        They build the foundation of all strength work going forward.<br><br><br>

        The best part? Building the foundation still makes you faster, as you naturally improve your form and don’t waste force as easily.<br><br><br>

        Because without a foundation, what’s going to happen to the force you put into the ground?<br><br><br>

        It becomes meaningless.<br><br><br>

        Combined with the fact that when you actually do those high-impact exercises?<br><br><br>

        You will absolutely pop off in speed gains.<br><br><br>

        Because you cleared the path to where now nothing (like injuries) can get in your way.<br><br><br>

        Remember, if you don’t want to do it now, you will have to do it in the future anyway, with regret.<br><br><br>

        Trust that it will get shorter from here, as the start is the most complicated (because the website just started and it needs to stay easy).<br><br><br>

        Now it’s time for your drive phase.<br><br><br>
