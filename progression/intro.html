    <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>What do I “need” to know before reading?</strong><br><br>
        Real quick, before you start reading and learning from this website, I’m going to assume that you already understand the very basics of sprinting biomechanics.<br><br>

        <strong>That includes:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Stride length and frequency</li>
            <li>Ground contact time (GCT)</li>
            <li>Basic force application and direction</li>
            <li>and a ton more…</li>
        </ul>

        Even if you don’t, you shouldn’t worry, as you might pick up on what those terms mean while reading, and they’re easy to look up quickly.<br><br>

        <strong>Think of this like the iceberg:</strong>

        On the top of the iceberg, you got the <strong>superficial</strong> stuff (almost everyone knows):
            <ul>
                <li>Stride length</li>
                <li>Stride frequency</li>
                <li>Force</li>
                <li>Start phase, top-speed phase</li>
            </ul>

        On the bottom of the iceberg, you have <strong>super specific</strong> details that nearly nobody talks about normally:
            <ul>
                <li>Knee landing (sprinters knees land slightly bent in top speed)</li>
                <li>Negative foot speed (foot moves backward before landing instead of waiting)</li>
                <li>Landing on toes is not true</li>
                <li>Coordination > strength</li>
                <li>Static stretching before sprinting is false</li>
                <li>and so many more…</li>
            </ul>

        Where the website sits in terms of complexity, <strong>it’s near the middle:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic backside mechanics</li>
                <li>Triple extension</li>
                <li>Shin angles</li>
                <li>Pelvic tilt</li>
                <li>Spine alignment</li>
            </ul>

        <strong>What even are sprinting biomechanics?</strong><br><br>
        Very simple, it’s just finding the scientific study of:<br><br>
        <strong>finding the right power output</strong> (balancing how much force you put into the ground and how fast) and how efficiently you can put those forces into the ground (good technique) to maximize your speed.<br><br>

        <strong>What should I expect?</strong><br><br>
        Expect to come out thinking like a sprinter, not just someone who sprints because their coach said so.<br><br>

        In this website, I’ll try to </strong>simplify</strong> some complicated sprinting biomechanic topics to the best of my ability without avoiding any key information.<br><br>

        I will not just blindly teach you the topics and call it a day, you will understand the why behind everything taught in this progression.<br><br>

        There will also be <strong>visual</strong> comparisons from my OWN sprinting technique to an elite sprinter on every topic that is covered by pointing out my flaws as well as what I did right and wrong so you can really understand how it actually looks like.<br><br>

        Not only that, but I’ll also teach you exercises, drills, even mental cues on how to actually train the topic you just learned as easily as possible.<br><br>

        The way the content is put on the website is designed to always make you constantly learn without randomly getting stuck on something that got hard out of nowhere. Going from easy to harder content as you go further down the progression ladder,<br><br>

        <strong>kind of like how an actual 100m sprint works.</strong><br><br>

        If you’re a more advanced sprinter or looking for something more specific, then you can click to start from wherever,<br><br>

        but like most of us, if you’re a beginner, I strongly recommend you start from the beginning.<br><br>

        It seems long to read everything, but trust me, you’ll be done reading this website with more knowledge faster than you’d expect.<br><br>

        And also ready and fired up to jump out of your chair…<br><br>

        <strong>THAT’S the magic of sprinting.</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Is this legit?</strong>
        There’s a <strong>bibliography</strong> page on the side and (sadly unclickable) embedded citations.<br><br>

        I didn’t let my self-taught knowledge <strong>carry</strong> the entire website.<br><br>

        I ensured that the knowledge you learn isn’t some myth to be busted or something you shouldn’t even care about, like toe dragging.<br><br>

        Also, I’ll include the force-velocity curve at the start of each phase of the website. You don’t have to understand it, but it’s <strong>recommended</strong> if you take a closer look.<br><br>
