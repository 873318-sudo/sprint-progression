    <h2>3.1: What even is that?</h2>
    <p>
        If you’re wondering what that even is…<br><br><br>

        Don’t worry, I barely knew what it was as well.<br><br><br>

        When I said “the drive phase is overlooked”, the transition phase would be an understatement for that,<br><br><br>

        it’s basically invisible.<br><br><br>

        The transition is supposed to last from the end of your drive phase to the start of your top speed, bridging that gap.<br><br><br>

        For elites, it starts around 30 and ends at 60 meters<br><br><br>

        Visually, it’s when you’re already near upright, right after the drive phase, already looking like you’re at top speed.<br><br><br>

        But since this is so overlooked, this is where you can become the most deadly.<br><br><br>

        If you think this phase of your sprint is just “mental prep to handle top speed.”<br><br><br>

        You’d be dead wrong.<br><br><br>

        Take Usain Bolt for example:<br><br><br>

        His speed kept going up, even after he was out of his drive phase.<br><br><br>

        All the way from 30 to 70 meters.<br><br><br>

        His split times were like this in 10m intervals⁽¹⁴⁾:<br><br><br>

        0.86, 0.83, 0.82, 0.81.<br><br><br>

        That’s a pretty massive portion of acceleration, especially that late into a 100m race.<br><br><br>

        This is one of the factors that made him keep winning his races, even if his start was not the best.<br><br><br>

        What’s actually going on is that the mechanics are changing over time,<br><br><br>

        …and here are the mechanics that changes in question:
        <ul>
            <li>Stride frequency increases even further</li>
            <li>Ground contact time drops significantly.</li>
            <li>Shin angle shifts from being forwards to nearly vertical</li>
            <li>Spine and head should be vertical at this point (with a very slight forward lean)</li>
            <li>Stride cycle changes, becoming a more cycling action</li>
            <li>Arm swing is swift and aggressive (“thumb to the eye, elbow to the sky⁽¹⁷⁾”)</li>
            <li>Relaxation becomes crucial</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>3.2: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        This is when you will truly understand why the transition phase is not random and actually critical (and cool)!<br><br><br>

        First of all, we have to understand the primary goal, more complicated than any of the other ones:<br><br><br>

        That being: continue to accelerate by shifting from horizontal force to fast vertical force as efficiently as possible.<br><br><br>

        Now here’s the breakdown of how that works:<br><br><br>

        When it comes to shifting horizontal force to rapid vertical movement, it basically means this:<br><br><br>

        Force vector shifts from horizontal to vertical.<br><br><br>

        “Force vector” is literally just the direction of force that you put into the track,<br><br><br>

        and you can usually tell the direction based on the shin angle when the foot touches the ground.<br><br><br>

        How do sprinters actually do that?<br><br><br>

        Well, most of it happens naturally, but…<br><br><br>

        The quads in acceleration shifts to the role of the hip flexors, including hamstrings and glutes getting increasingly more important⁽¹⁴⁾.<br><br><br>

        And the muscles involved are responsible for recycling the force from acceleration, now as quickly as possible,<br><br><br>

        it’s not your stride length increasing from more force,<br><br><br>

        this is why ground contact time drops and stride frequency increases.<br><br><br>

        And just like all other primary goals, this will apply for every mechanic that was mentioned for this phase,<br><br><br>

        like, shin angles being vertical?<br><br><br>

        Simply because the force vector needs to be vertical.<br><br><br>

        That's it for the explanation.<br><br><br>

        “But wait! Where is the secondary goal? Why vertical force specifically?”<br><br><br>

        There is no secondary goal,<br><br><br>

        and that’s because the primary goal literally explains everything you need to know about the transition phase.<br><br><br>

        For forces being vertical?<br><br><br>

        That’s a whole different reason, and I can explain it as easily as possible,<br><br><br>

        simply put, it improves your recycling efficiency by improving your stretch-shortening cycle⁽¹⁵⁾,<br><br><br>

        That basically explains the speed muscles expanding and shortening upon contact get faster.<br><br><br>

        Well that was a bit of a change in difficulty, right?<br><br><br>

        However, do you realize that you still manage to understand it?<br><br><br>

        That’s the beauty of the progression.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>3.3: Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        As we know, the transition phase is mostly invisible to the naked eye without actually slowing it down and measuring the stats (like stride frequency increasing).<br><br><br>

        But, we can try our best to make something out of it.<br><br><br>

        You know the drill, what do you notice?<br><br><br>

        Well, but not really notice visually this time,<br><br><br>

        it’s more like trying to tell what intention is different based on the static image.<br><br><br>

        And no, the knees being higher is not different, that’s just at different parts of the stride.<br><br><br>

        Well, it is nearly impossible to tell just from an image, but since I sprinted to record that photo, I can confidently say that…<br><br><br>

        The intentions were very different.<br><br><br>

        When I got upright, my body naturally assumed I was already at full blast without transitioning.<br><br><br>

        Because of that, my stride frequency flatlined.<br><br><br>

        While if you watched the video in motion (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwGi9S7wkgk), you can see that Powell’s stride frequency kept increasing.<br><br><br>

        One more big thing to point out that I noticed (and you can maybe see in the photo too) is that…<br><br><br>

        I’m passively applying force.<br><br><br>

        You can likely see this from the foot,<br><br><br>

        It looks like it’s just landing normally instead of actively striking down under my hips.<br><br><br>

        And that’s a big separator to apply vertical force AFAP.<br><br><br>

        And then if you saw a quick look at Asafa Powell’s video, he pulls the foot back right before landing.<br><br><br>

        That’s called negative foot speed, for the sake of complexity, I’ll leave it out.<br><br><br>

        Just know that it allows him to apply much higher forces WAY FASTER, especially right after the foot strikes.<br><br><br>

        But if you do your own research on that (which I recommend), then just know that you will feel like you unlocked a hidden gem for such a small detail.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>3.4: Application</h2>
    <p>
        Now, when it comes to applying this to your training as easily as possible.<br><br><br>

        It may seem hard at first to train something that is basically invisible,<br><br><br>

        so you can’t really see or feel if you’re doing it right or wrong.<br><br><br>

        Or can you?<br><br><br>

        Seeing it is hard, yes, but feeling if you’re doing it right is a whole different story.<br><br><br>

        This is where asking yourself questions after each rep becomes super important.<br><br><br>

        Otherwise, it just means nothing.<br><br><br>

        Say you do 60 meter sprints.<br><br><br>

        Don’t just “do” the 60 meter sprint, FEEL yourself using that vertical force being applied into the ground as fast as possible.<br><br><br>

        It may seem weird at first, but that’s a sign that it’s working.<br><br><br>

        Now, for the actual exercises and drills that you can do to target your transition phase:
        <ul>
            <li>Flying sprints (main focus on the slow build-up)</li>
            <li>Starts with ramping up intensity (like 50% effort to 100% when upright)</li>
            <li>Sled sprints with a focus on naturally shifting force</li>
        </ul>

        There are only a few? Right?<br><br><br>

        Well, that’s because most of the exercises from the other phases carryover to this phase,<br><br><br>

        the ones provided are just the most unique ones.<br><br><br>

        If you do these consistently, I guarantee you, you will be able to FEEL that your stride frequency is getting faster mid-race.<br><br><br>

        Now it’s time to transition to your top speed.<br><br><br>
