    <h2>2.1: How to drive?</h2>
    <p>          
        If you’re in high school, you might commonly notice that the drive phase gets overlooked in sprint training.<br><br><br>

        They either care too much about the start or top speed.<br><br><br>

        Here’s the thing:<br><br><br>

        The drive phase is easy, if the start sets it up properly.<br><br><br>

        In most elite sprinters, the drive phase lasts from 3-30m (3 because of the start).<br><br><br>

        The mechanics don’t really change from the first step to the drive phase. However…<br><br><br>

        The key element is that your torso and your shin angles rise gradually as you pick up speed.<br><br><br>

        So, the mechanics would be this⁽¹⁰⁾:
        <ul>
            <li>Torso rises gradually (45 degrees to nearly upright by 30m)</li>
            <li>Shin angle matches torso angle</li>
            <li>Arms stay aggressive so you don’t fall</li>
            <li>Triple extension</li>
        </ul>
        
        As mentioned in your start, you need to feel like you’re pushing the earth under you.<br><br><br>

        You will also feel your strides naturally getting faster…and longer,<br><br><br>

        that’s what you want.<br><br><br>

        If you really want to feel yourself actually driving in your training, some people even do what is called a valsalva maneuver…<br><br><br>

        Or simply,<br><br><br>

        holding your breath to engage the core and releasing the air gradually⁽¹¹⁾.<br><br><br>

        It’s like the human form of an exhaust!<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>2.2: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        Once again, why?<br><br><br>

        Why do we drive?<br><br><br>

        What’s so important that I even had to separate the drive phase from the start yet the mechanics are so similar?<br><br><br>

        To answer why I even separated, the primary goals are different, which is what answers that.<br><br><br>

        And the primary goal is…<br><br><br>

        Reach the highest speeds possible before transitioning to top speed.<br><br><br>

        Sounds pretty obvious, right?<br><br><br>

        As you already heard from the start, it should overcome your inertia.<br><br><br>

        Now that you have already started moving, it’s natural that you need to pick up your speed as fast as possible.<br><br><br>

        That’s how a sprint works.<br><br><br>

        Now the secondary goal?<br><br><br>

        Be patient.<br><br><br>

        Woah dude, woah…let’s slow down there.<br><br><br>

        Having patience in a sprint?<br><br><br>

        That sounds like the secondary goal feels CONTRADICTING to the primary goal?<br><br><br>

        Doesn’t sound right to me…<br><br><br>

        Well, it doesn’t…until I explain it,<br><br><br>

        let me explain why you even need patience in a race that lasts only 100m.<br><br><br>

        First of all, when I say patience, I don’t mean the marathon endurance level of patience that’s required for those kinds of races,<br><br><br>

        no,<br><br><br>

        in sprinting, patience is totally something else.<br><br><br>

        Patience is more in your mental state rather than mentally thinking “faster, faster…FASTER”⁽¹²⁾.<br><br><br>

        What does that mean?<br><br><br>

        “Patience” in your mental state should relax you during the race,<br><br><br>

        mainly your face, hands, and other muscles in your body that don’t need to be stiff.<br><br><br>

        Simply execute what you’ve done in your training.<br><br><br>

        That’s it.<br><br><br>

        And just like patience, don’t confuse relaxation with a lack of effort.<br><br><br>

        Nothing, not even a race that lasts 10 seconds for the best of athletes can rush⁽¹³⁾.<br><br><br>

        For the explanation, that is the explanation to why we drive that your start phase hasn’t already answered:<br><br><br>

        Gradually pick up your speed without rushing.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>2.3: Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Now it’s time to put your even deeper knowledge of the start (or I guess late start) into play.<br><br><br>

        The photo you see is the late drive phase for both me and Asafa Powell, just at different parts of the stride, so we’re nearly upright.<br><br><br>

        As always, what do you notice before I tell you?<br><br><br>

        One thing’s for certain is our head positions,<br><br><br>

        my head is more forwards already,<br><br><br>

        while Powell’s head is still slightly neutral, looking down at the track.<br><br><br>

        That matters, even when you’re almost upright, the force still needs to be applied horizontally.<br><br><br>

        Another thing I noticed is Powell’s shin angles compared to mines, two things actually:
        He’s still recovering the back foot low, mines is basically doing the figure-4 (foreshadowing) and<br><br><br>

        his shin angles match his torso way better than mines (see the front foot)<br><br><br>

        The last main thing that I’ve noticed is the spine,<br><br><br>

        Powell’s posture is a straight line from head to the hips, which is optimal<br><br><br>

        mine is more rounded and “forward”, especially in the shoulders.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>2.4: Application</h2>
    <p>
        Now for applying it to your training.<br><br><br>

        If you’re still struggling with the fundamentals that were mentioned in the start, then continue doing that.<br><br><br>

        But let’s assume that you’re already solid and ready to step up your training.<br><br><br>

        In that case, these are the best exercises/drills you can do to maximize your drive phase:
        <ul>
            <li>Sled training</li>
            <li>Hill sprints</li>
            <li>Wall drills (like fast switching legs, getting into good body angles)</li>
            <li>In general? Anything that reinforces low body angle and improves strength.</li>
        </ul>

        Notice how most of these exercises and drills involve strength under speed?<br><br><br>

        If you understand that, then you’ll know which exercises work for improving the drive phase, and which ones don’t.<br><br><br>

        And boom, that’s it for the application, much shorter than the start, right?<br><br><br>

        I told you it will get faster from here, just like you will in your 100m race.<br><br><br>

        Now it’s time for the MOST “invisible phase” in sprinting: your transition phase.<br><br><br>
