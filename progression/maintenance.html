    <h2>5.1: Endurance in a sprint?</h2>
    <p>
        Just like you’ve heard in the drive phase.<br><br><br>

        Patience in a 100m sprint sounded weird at first.<br><br><br>

        That is also true for endurance in the 100m.<br><br><br>

        But once again, not in the way that you might expect.<br><br><br>

        As mentioned in top speed, as soon as you hit it, it’s all about maintaining that top speed for as long as possible.<br><br><br>

        No matter how fast you are, you will decelerate near the end of the race after you hit top speed.<br><br><br>

        Don’t believe me?<br><br><br>

        Look at Usain Bolt’s splits after 70 meters⁽²⁴⁾.<br><br><br>

        60 - 70m: 0.81 (fastest)
        70 - 80m: 0.82
        80 - 90m: 0.83
        90 - 100m: 0.83<br><br><br>

        He slowed down after he hit his top speed.<br><br><br>

        The person who looks like they are speeding up at the end of the race to win is actually the one that decelerates the least.<br><br><br>

        Once you hit the peak of the mountain, the only place you can go is down.<br><br><br>

        You have to try and stay at the top of the mountain for as long as possible.<br><br><br>

        So what does this mean?<br><br><br>

        It means that relaxation after reaching your top speed in a race becomes more critical than any other point.<br><br><br>

        Your top speed mechanics shouldn’t change.<br><br><br>

        You’re still trying to apply as much vertical force as possible in the littlest time.<br><br><br>

        If you tense up when you’re tired, what does that do?<br><br><br>

        It makes your body move slower.<br><br><br>

        Try to throw a punch when your arm is flexed vs. when it is relaxed.<br><br><br>

        Huge difference.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>5.2: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        I believe that at this point in the website you’ve built enough knowledge to try and make a primary goal for this phase of the race.<br><br><br>

        If you thought something like:<br><br><br>

        “Be the last one to crumble”<br><br><br>

        You would be correct.<br><br><br>

        We’ve already established that the person who wins is usually the person who decelerates the least.<br><br><br>

        But…why is deceleration inevitable?<br><br><br>

        Well, it’s simple, unbelievably simple.<br><br><br>

        During anaerobic exercise (like sprinting), your body uses glycogen (like sugar) that is stored in the muscles.<br><br><br>

        This is because your body needs to produce max effort without the need of oxygen⁽²⁵⁾.<br><br><br>

        And it can only do this for around 5 to 10 seconds for maximum effort before needing oxygen.<br><br><br>

        Even more simply put: your body can’t sustain true 100% top speed for a full 100m race, no matter how good you are.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>5.3: Analysis...?</h2>
    <p>
        Is there even an analysis for this kind of phase?<br><br><br>

        Nope, that’s why I left it out.<br><br><br>

        As we already know, the mechanics during top speed maintenance stay the same.<br><br><br>

        If your speed endurance is bad, the stuff you may notice are your mechanics falling apart. Which is not what you want.<br><br><br>

        That’s the only thing to look out for.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>5.4: Application</h2>
    <p>
        Now the best part is this: applying speed endurance into your training, not the long-form endurance.<br><br><br>

        As speed endurance is different, it focuses on relaxation and holding your mechanics well this late into a sprint.<br><br><br>

        And you do that by sub-max sprinting.<br><br><br>

        It’s exactly as it sounds:<br><br><br>

        You do longer sprints (usually around 120-150 meters) at a sustained high effort (like 95%) with a focus on floating and not letting your mechanics fall apart.<br><br><br>

        That's. It.<br><br><br>

        And one thing to note before we end this off:<br><br><br>

        Relaxation is a skill, not a natural talent or something you “command” to happen on the day of your race.<br><br><br>

        You gain this skill from what we just mentioned:<br><br><br>

        focus on floating or “cruising” when you hit upright sprinting, don’t tense unnecessary muscles.<br><br><br>

        Now you should read the conclusion.<br><br><br>
