    <h2>4.1: Am I really hitting true top speed?</h2>
    <p>
        Let me get something straight with you,<br><br><br>

        most people, either:<br><br><br>
        hit top speed too early and fall off<br><br><br>
        or worse, never even hit their REAL top speed.<br><br><br>

        Why?<br><br><br>

        Because their training methods are not optimal.<br><br><br>

        that could be from⁽¹⁶⁾:
        <ul>
            <li>little to no recovery between reps</li>
            <li>straight up not training the right stuff</li>
            <li>no recovery between days as well</li>
            <li>just going through the motions</li>
            <li>and more…</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br><br>
        They’re either training maintenance or the drive phase when they actually want to train top speed.<br><br><br>

        This is different from overlooking the drive or transition phase,<br><br><br>

        because with top speed, people train it wrong, but for overlooked phases? They don’t train it entirely.<br><br><br>

        And here’s another catch:<br><br><br>

        As soon as you hit top speed, it’s all about the maintenance phase.<br><br><br>

        So why did I separate them?<br><br><br>

        Because the goals are different.<br><br><br>

        This phase actually makes sure that you’re hitting top speed.<br><br><br>

        The maintenance phase tries to keep it as long as possible. Because what’s maintenance without top speed?<br><br><br>

        Pointless.<br><br><br>

        There are a thousand different reasons as to why some sprinters never hit their true top speed, but for now,<br><br><br>

        here are the mechanics to look out for:
        <ul>
            <li>The figure 4 (legs hit a figure 4 position when recovering from the side view)</li>
            <li>Relaxed face, jaw, and hands</li>
            <li>Aggressive arms (MOSTLY 90-90 degrees at start and end points of the swing)</li>
            <li>Cyclical motion (part of figure-4)</li>
            <li>Stride frequency and length at the peak</li>
        </ul>
        
        Sounds deadly similar to the transition phase?<br><br><br>

        ‘Cause that’s basically the point, the transition phase should’ve eased you into this phase.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>4.2: Importance</h2>
    <p>
        It’s super obvious to understand that:<br><br><br>

        when you’re at top speed, stride length and stride frequency are at the highest.<br><br><br>

        Because those are the two factors for speed, according to the biomechanical formula⁽¹⁸⁾.<br><br><br>

        So what am I actually going to explain here?<br><br><br>

        The figure-4 that you noticed.<br><br><br>

        In short (and simple), the figure-4 is just a fancy, made up name⁽²⁰⁾ for a technique to where when the foot strikes the ground, you can draw out the number 4 on their leg cycle.<br><br><br>

        For what it looks like?<br><br><br>

        Just imagine your two legs, from a side view the bones of your legs make it look like the number 4.<br><br><br>

        …and you can just look at the analysis photo and try to draw out the number four on the legs, see if it matches.<br><br><br>

        Now most importantly, how is figure 4 effective?<br><br><br>

        We have to introduce yet another topic: backside mechanics.<br><br><br>

        There’s lots of depth and complexity when it comes to this topic, but just for you to understand what it is, it means:<br><br><br>

        anything happens in your legs behind your center of mass/hip⁽²¹⁾ are backside mechanics.<br><br><br>

        So, by proper logic, we want to minimize this as much as possible so we can have the best stride frequency we can achieve.<br><br><br>

        And one of the best ways to do that?<br><br><br>

        The figure-4.<br><br><br>

        How do I do it?<br><br><br>

        In order, it goes like this⁽²²⁾:
        <ul>
            <li>bring your foot up to your thigh</li>
            <li>relax the calf (so knee is 90 degrees)</li>
            <li>strike down under your hip</li>
            <li>do the same for the other leg</li>
            <li>add movement</li>
            <li>progress speed until you can full sprint with it</li>
        </ul>
        
        That’s it. You’ve unlocked the figure-4.<br><br><br>

        We don’t even need a primary goal, or secondary goal.<br><br><br>

        In fact, you can basically consider “fast legs without affecting stride length” the primary goal.<br><br><br>

        It’s that simple, just like I said though, ONLY if the rest of your sprint set it up right.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>4.3: Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Now, let’s analyse it with your new profound knowledge about top speed…and the figure-4.<br><br><br> 

        First off, I don’t even have to tell you, you can immediately notice the figure-4 on BOTH images.<br><br><br>

        Although Powell’s is more blurry, that’s just how fast he is.<br><br><br>

        You can notice Powell’s back foot higher than mine, but isn’t our goal to minimize backside mechanics?<br><br><br>

        Well, yes, but…<br><br><br>

        He is high because he is a tall sprinter (more than 6 ft), so it’s basically a natural occurrence,<br><br><br>

        not only that, high heel recovery actually improves your stride frequency by setting you up for the next step⁽²³⁾.<br><br><br>

        So yeah, it’s a good thing for him.<br><br><br>

        One more main thing to point out, and it’s not even about the figure-4…<br><br><br>

        Powell’s posture is WAY better than mine.<br><br><br>

        Most obviously, he has a much stronger forward lean, especially for upright sprinting,<br><br><br>

        which MAY help with better stride frequency.<br><br><br>

        And he also has a better head position, it’s more neutral towards his body angle.<br><br><br>

        Me? It just looks like I’m looking straight intentionally, which can waste energy, every tiny flaw can count.<br><br><br>

        Lastly, the arm action, you can tell based on the motion blur differences that his arm swing is way more aggressive and faster than mine.<br><br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>4.4: Application</h2>
    <p>
        Now what you probably care about most for this specific phase, how do I train it?<br><br><br>

        Because training top speed just feels wrong, and impossible.<br><br><br>

        Well, it isn’t, it’s still very trainable,<br><br><br>

        just different from the “max strength acceleration” you usually think of.<br><br><br>

        I’m going to just straight up give you the exercises/drills:<br><br><br> 
        <ul>
            <li>Flying sprints (focus on hitting it after the build up)</li>
            <li>Pogo hops and other reactive plyometrics</li>
            <li>Hamstring curls</li>
            <li>Depth jumps</li>
            <li>Overspeed training</li>
        </ul>
        
        Let me touch on 2 things: overspeed training and reactive plyometrics real quick.<br><br><br>

        Overspeed training is very self-explanatory, simply training your top speed higher than it actually is.<br><br><br>

        That can be done by downhill sprinting (around 1-3 percent downhill) and banded sprints (you and a partner attach resistance bands together, your partner runs and the resistance band propels you forward)<br><br><br>

        For reactive plyometrics, it’s basically training to improve your elasticity (ability to apply force and recycle it)<br><br><br>

        Reactive plyometrics and elasticity can be interchangeable in terms of definition.<br><br><br>

        In terms of the metrics, your ground contact time should be under 250 milliseconds.<br><br><br>

        Exercises like pogo hops (as mentioned), bounding, jumping lunges, skater hops, and more, all train your elasticity.<br><br><br>

        Now that your top speed is locked in,<br><br><br>

        it’s time to slow down into your maintenance phase.<br><br><br>
