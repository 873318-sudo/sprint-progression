            <p>
                Have you ever been <strong>stuck</strong> in training? Going consistently, putting in the work?

                Even if you're not, you're still disappointed because you're <strong>not getting the results</strong> you want?

                Don't worry, we've all been there.

                Whether you're a beginner or a more experienced athlete looking to <strong>improve their</strong> speed,

                I guarantee that you will learn something from this project that you can <strong>easily apply</strong> to your training.

                By providing a <strong>clear, structured progression</strong> and teaching simplified biomechanics concepts (while keeping them accurate),

                <strong>this will maximize your speed potential.</strong>

                Expect this to be a little bit <strong>different</strong> from your traditional “this one thing is killing your speed” videos you stumble upon.

                 <strong>Ready to SHATTER your personal best</strong>?

            <p>
                My name is Jacob, I am 15 years old and I spent the majority of my middle school and grade 9 years learning about different sprinting techniques and training methods from different videos and articles. I have had a deep passion for both learning and training to become faster ever since I was a kid, so I have decided to use this passion in order to create this website to teach <strong>you, the athlete,</strong> how to get faster, clearly, effectively, and <strong>without any annoying distractions getting in your way</strong>.
